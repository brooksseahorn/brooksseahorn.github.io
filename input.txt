High-Performance Computing (HPC) is a critical area of study for those interested in solving complex computational problems. HPC involves the use of supercomputers and parallel processing techniques to run advanced applications efficiently, reliably, and quickly.

One of the key components of HPC is the job scheduler, and Slurm (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is one of the most widely used job schedulers in the HPC community. Slurm is an open-source, highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system for large and small Linux clusters.

### Key Concepts in HPC:
1. **Parallel Computing**: The simultaneous use of multiple compute resources to solve a computational problem.
2. **Cluster**: A set of connected computers that work together so that they can be viewed as a single system.
3. **Node**: An individual computer within a cluster.
4. **Job**: A unit of work submitted to the HPC system, which can consist of multiple tasks.
5. **Task**: A single unit of execution within a job.

### Introduction to Slurm:
Slurm manages resources and schedules jobs on HPC clusters. It provides three key functions:
1. **Allocating Resources**: Assigning compute nodes to jobs.
2. **Job Queuing**: Managing a queue of jobs waiting to be executed.
3. **Job Execution**: Launching and monitoring jobs on allocated nodes.

### Basic Slurm Commands:
- `srun`: Used to submit a job for execution.
- `sbatch`: Used to submit a job script for batch execution.
- `squeue`: Displays information about jobs in the queue.
- `scancel`: Cancels a pending or running job.

### Example Slurm Job Script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=example_job
#SBATCH --output=example_job.out
#SBATCH --error=example_job.err
#SBATCH --ntasks=4
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00
#SBATCH --partition=compute

# Load necessary modules
module load gcc/9.3.0
module load openmpi/4.0.3

# Run the application
srun ./my_hpc_application
